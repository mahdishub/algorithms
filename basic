Planning 3 types:
-Domain specific : problem specific, navigation of a robot through a two or three dimensional space.Theese planners are used when effcieny
is vital.
-Domain independent : uses generic representations and exploits the commonalities among different types of planning,algorithms
are comparitively slower than domain specific planners.
-Configurable(?)

Conceptual Model : A theoretical device used for describing the elements of a problem.
State transition systems are used.
 Σ(S,A,E,γ)
 S-> states the world can be in.
 A->actions that can be performed by agent.
 E-> events that can happen in the world.
 γ->state transition function
 γ = S*(A∪E) -> 2^s(?)
 an action a is applicable, i.e , a ∈ A, if  γ(s,a) != {∅}.
 so there if an action a is applicable, there is a  s'= γ(s,a);
